By using the MgO substrate itself as an\\noptical resonator, we can reference the Faraday and Kerr rotations to each\\nother. We observe a low-frequency Kerr rotation on the order of several hundred\\nmicroradians in the superconducting phase, a clear signature consistent with\\nTRS-breaking superconductivity. Our measurements enable direct access to the\\nTHz-range Hall conductivity. Through a Kramers-Kronig analysis, we link these\\nlow-energy measurements to prior high-frequency magneto-optic Kerr effect\\n(MOKE) data. This connection provides critical insight into the nature of the\\nTRS-breaking state, supporting a multiband superconducting scenario over a\\ndisordered single-band interpretation for the origin of the Kerr effect.\",\n          \"We investigate electron pairing in a super clean kagome superconductor\\nCsV3Sb5 with a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of 290.

We introduce nonmagnetic impurities to observe the\\ncomplete suppression of 2x2 pairing modulations in presence of persistent 2x2\\ncharge order. This nonmagnetic pair-breaking effect provides phase-sensitive\\nevidence for pair-density-wave (PDW) induced pairing modulations.
