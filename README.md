# Project-on-AI
This project focuses on developing a Large Language Model (LLM) that predicts the future potential and impact of a research paper before publication. The model analyzes the paper alongside existing literature, current trends, and contextual signals to estimate its relevance, novelty, and possible long-term influence.
